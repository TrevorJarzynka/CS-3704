Project Description:
Our code analyzer will provide an online dashboard showing team members coding styles. This tool will enable project managers to gain deeper insights into their developers approaches, facilitating the creation of more efficient and cohesive teams. In addition, we will implement a code database that stores small snippets of code written by people within the company to mitigate copying online code which can lead to cyber security issues.
